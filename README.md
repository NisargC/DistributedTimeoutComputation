#JustInTimeout DistributedTimeoutComputation

The broker is designed in 2 different modes.

* MultiProcess mode (Single Docker)
* MultiDocker mode

Please find the individual README files in their respective folders containing detailed setup steps.

The results of the paper are all using the MultiProcess mode. This is because the MultiDocker mode is not entirely working as intended. There are some issues being faced with when nodes abruptly leave the system.

The remaining project files can be found in the folder `Remaining_files`. The paper details the approaches and results.
